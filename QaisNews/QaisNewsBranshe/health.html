On one hand, it’s a time for most to try and reestablish a “normal” routine, take a breather and recalibrate after the holiday season. But it’s also the moment when we can feel pressured to set resolutions, intentions and other self-improvements for the new year.<br>On top of that, the weather isn’t doing us any favors. January and February can be the gloomiest months for people who experience seasonal affective disorder, or SAD.  Even if you’re the type of person who wakes up on New Year’s Day ready to go with an agenda for the year, a flare of ambition can lead to burnout quickly.</h4>
